          <p>Hi! My given name is <u>Danielle Sison</u>, <b>NUX</b> is my pending tradename. I am a bootcamp student (Full-stack developer) at the University of Texas at Austin. 
            This online portfolio showcases the projects I have worked on during my enrollment in the program and it serves as the basis of my capabilities within the scope of coding. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Within current professional boundaries, I am a drug dealer... legally. I bet the preceding statement shocked you initially, but I do have an explanation. 
            My previous and current career background is in the world of pharmacy, to put it in plain text... I am a pharmacist. 
            I've earned my credentials from Southeast Asia, and to be more precise, from the Philippines. I had graduated at the top of my class with the distinction of Cum Laude. 
            In present time, I am working as a procurement and inventory coordinator for the company I work at for almost a decade. <br>
          </p> 
          <p>I am pretty sure you are asking why am I going through this program? <i>"You already have a beautiful career"</i>, as many say so. 
            I can answer this question in many ways but if an honest answer is what you are seeking for, my response would be... it is because I want to change my career into 
            something I truly love, into something that I am genuinely interested in, and into, what I believe, is my calling. Technology or computers has always
          been something that was easy for me to understand as a little lady. To put it simply, anything in this field naturally flows for me. Consequently, I want to
          be able to contribute to society by growth and development through this path.
          </p>
          <p>Despite my realization into my true calling, I recognize that I have much to learn, and I have much to catch up on, in terms of learning how to code, or just to be merely
            up to date within this field. Nonetheless, I am open to expanding my intellect towards this area of expertise, and I continuously stay motivated for my family, my friends,
            and myself. Please continue on below to see the projects that I have worked on, thank you!
          </p>
